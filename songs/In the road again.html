		One, two, a one, two, three, four</br>
		On the road again</br>
		Just can't wait to get on the road again</br>
		The life I love is making music with my friends</br>
		And I can't wait to get on the road again</br>
		On the road again</br>
		Goin' places that I've never been</br>
		Seein' things that I may never see again</br>
		And I can't wait to get on the road again</br>
		On the road again</br>
		Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway</br>
		We're the best of friends</br>
		Insisting that the world keep turning our way</br>
		And our way</br>
		Is on the road again</br>
		I just can't wait to get on the road again</br>
		The life I love is makin' music with my friends</br>
		And I can't wait to get on the road again</br>
